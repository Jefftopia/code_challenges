1) Each variant should just be referenced by its SKU code.

2) They should be brought to a cart preview screen that shows the contents of their cart
and asks them if they want to continue shopping or checkout the items they added.

3) The UI should be very different on mobile, the wireframe is very desktop orientation specific.
The product image should be a swipeable slideshow instead of clickable previews. 
Then immediately under that slideshow should be the description, followed by the type selection with price.
Then add to cart should be at the very bottom of the screen.

4) In my product root class there is a skeleton function that just gets the json file from local storage.
This could easily be replaced with an ajax call, and the render would have to be modified a little bit
to render some sort of a loading animation while the ajax call is waiting for a response.
